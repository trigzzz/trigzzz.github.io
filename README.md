# React E-commerce Store

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- React Router
- Netlify (for deployment)


## Approach

When creating this Streetwear Store, I used React for a modular front-end structure, incorporating Redux for centralized state management. The application seamlessly integrates both static data and an external API, providing users with an extensive product selection through the ProductList component. The responsive design, achieved with CSS and styled-components, ensures an optimal viewing experience. The project is deployed on Netlify, making the live site accessible to users.
